# Rapid Prototyping

## A code repository that is my own dumping ground...

This is a repository dedicated to scripts or code snippets used to test out an idea. If I have something that doesn't really fit into its own project or if I need a code snippet that I need to test before a project integration, it will probably be found here.

The different scripts present here, may or may not be linked to each other.

I find storing these scripts and snippets in one place helpful, in case I need to do something similar again. If I want to see how an object looks on the standard output or if I have a code snippet that takes a word and splits it in half... things like those can be stored here.
